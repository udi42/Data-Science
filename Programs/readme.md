# Data-Science Programs

The program are done in **Jupyter Notebook,** To install follow the steps:
> pip install notebook

To Run Jupyter Notebook, In cmd type
> jupyter notebook


## Program 1
Consider the **auto-mpg dataset** and perform exploratory data analysis. 
<ol>
    <li>Identify the dimension, structure, and summary of the data set.</li>
    <li>Plot the histogram for variables.</li>
    <li>Recognize the outliers using box plot (Display the box plot before and after outlier treatment)</li>
    <li>Check for “na” and treat them Standardize the continuous variable (if any)</li>
</ol>

## Program 2
For the **data set in Program 1,**
<ol>
    <li>Show the distribution of continuous variables using histogram.</li>
    <li>Identify two continuous variables using scatter plot.</li> 
    <li>Find and display the frequency of the categorical values using count plot.</li>
    <li>Apply point plots to display one continuous and one categorical variable.</li>
</ol>

## Program 3
Consider the **health care dataset** that consists of several imaging details from patients that had a biopsy to test for breast cancer. The variable diagnosis classifies the biopsied tissue as M = malignant or B = benign. Use KNN supervised learning model to predict Diagnosis using texture_mean and radius_mean . Analyze the model using different k values and display the performance of the model.

## Program 4
Consider the **student_performance dataset.** Predict the student performance as **“Pass” or “Fail”** by implementing a decision tree. Identify the important feature affecting the student performance and analyze the efficiency of the decision tree using different metrics. Plot the decision tree.

## Program 5
For the **dataset in Progrma 4,** apply random forest algorithm to predict the student performance.
<ol>
    <li>Plot the important variables using seaborn.</li>
    <li>Tune the random forest for training and test data based on best parameters and implement it.</li>
    <li>Analyze the model performance and display the output.</li>
</ol>

## Program 6
For the **market_basket dataset,** apply apriori algorithm and identify the best rules based on support and confidence values.

## Program 7
For the **Mall-Customers dataset.** Implement k-means clustering algorithm and visualize the clusters

## Program 8
Consider the given **text dataset.** Implement different text processing techniques and identify the most important keywords from the text. Display a word cloud from the same.

## Program 9
Consider the **iris dataset** and apply the Multilayer perceptron to classify the type of the flower. Analyze the performance of the perceptron and display the output.

## Program 10
Consider the **MNIST dataset** and implement CNN architecture to identify the handwritten images. Optimize the model and display the output.
